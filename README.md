# # Tetris
## Tetris is a tile-matching video game created by Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. It has been published by several companies, most prominently during a dispute over the appropriation of the game's rights in the late 1980s.


Allow the user to:
- move the incoming blocks left or right by pressing arrow keys.
- move the incoming blocks down by pressing down arrow key.
- see the next incoming block from the top left corner of the screen. 
- Maintain the tetris pattern after the block has settled at the bottom.


## Getting the project running
After cloning the repository or downloading the project, navigate to the project directory and click on the "START" button. This will start the game.
If the blocks reach the limiting height of the game then the game ends and the user can restart the game again by simply clicking on the "START" button.
